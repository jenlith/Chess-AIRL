# Meeting 1
Feb 4, 2023

Links added and summarised
User stories completed
Need statement written
Preliminary specifications developed

For next meeting:
- How should I estimate time for the user stories??
- Jen should review my user stories to verify that I've completed them correctly
- Jen says "working on a project from scratch without a guideline on how a program or system should work" and I want to dive into that a little more
- Should we break specifications down into which are relevant for which user, then prioritise the basic users before adding on later?
- Should we consider ourselves in user stories as developers because our skill development is a core part of the project?
- Break the project down into key parts, and assign primary or secondary ownership of each of these parts
