[lichess API reference](https://lichess.org/api)
Possible source to use as chess engine/AI
- [Bot API section](https://lichess.org/api#tag/Bot)
	- [An example of working with the AI?](http://www.oliviermercier.com/res/projects/chessboard/)
	- [Bot Account](https://lichess.org/api#tag/Bot/operation/botAccountUpgrade) - Is it possible to play without accounts? Might have to understand how it tracks info for this
Looks like we may have to pay to use the API (or at least create a lichess account)
